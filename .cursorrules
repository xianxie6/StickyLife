# Project Context: StickyLife
We are building a desktop widget app using Tauri (Rust) + React + TypeScript + Three.js.

## Product Vision
- A transparent, always-on-bottom desktop overlay for sticky notes.
- Aesthetic: "Skeuomorphism Ultra" (Frosted glass + Paper texture).
- Mascot: "Neno" (A stack of yellow sticky notes with a dog-ear).

## Tech Stack Rules
- Frontend: React, TailwindCSS (for UI), Three.js (for Neno).
- Backend: Electron (Node.js).
- Key Behavior: The window must be transparent and click-through (ignore mouse events) on empty areas.

## Design System
- Main Color: #FFF9C4 (Sticky Note Yellow).
- Font: Handwritten style preferred for notes.
- Vibe: Cozy, Tactile, Airy.
